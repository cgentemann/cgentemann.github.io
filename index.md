excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a passionate advocate for open science, open source software, and inclusivity. As a physical oceanographer focused on remote sensing, I have worked for over 25 years on retrievals of ocean temperature from space and using that data to understand how the ocean impacts our lives. More recently, I am focused on [Butterfly](https://nasa-butterfly.github.io/), a proposal for a new NASA mission, and advancing open science for societal benefit.
