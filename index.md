excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am an advocate for better science through openness and collaborations. As a computational physical oceanographer focused on remote sensing, I have worked for over 25 years on retrievals of ocean temperature from space and using that data to understand how the ocean impacts our lives. More recently, I am the open science program scientist at NASA Science Mission Directorate's Office of the Chief Science Data Officer. 

I have an open by default policy for all my research, teaching, and speaking. I try to post talks and presentations on this website and my code is all freely available, with a permissive license, [online](https://github.com/cgentemann/).
