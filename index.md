excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a passionate advocate for open science, open source software, and inclusivity.  As a physical oceanographer focused on remote sensing, I have worked for over 25 years on retrievals of ocean temperature from space and using that data to understand how the ocean impacts our lives.  My more recent research focuses on interdisciplinary science using cloud computing, open source software algorithm development, air-sea fluxes, biophysical interactions, and upper ocean physical processes.  I have served on scientific committees, notably on NOAA's Science Advisory Board and as co-chair of a standing committee for the National Academy of Sciences. I presented to a federal house committee on NASA's implementation of scientific community priorities.
