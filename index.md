excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a passionate advocate for open science, open source software, and inclusivity. As a physical oceanographer focused on remote sensing, I have worked for over 25 years on retrievals of ocean temperature from space and using that data to understand how the ocean impacts our lives. More recently, I am focused on NASA's Transform to Open Science ([TOPS])(https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science) and the 2023 Year of Open Science.

I have an open by default policy for all my research, teaching, and speaking. I try to post talks and presentations on this website and my code is all freely available, with a permissive license, [online](https://github.com/cgentemann/).
